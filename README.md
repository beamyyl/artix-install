My own made automatic artix installer for any init system you want (with BIOS and UEFI support ofc)
make sure to make it executable in the live artix installer first, ofc, with 'chmod +x artix-firmware-init-installer.sh', then run it with ./artix-firmware-init-installer.sh
and ALSO, EVERY SINGLE SCRIPT SHOULD BE RUN FROM THE OFFICIAL ARTIX !! OPENRC !! ISO, EVEN IF YOU WANT SOMETHING OTHER THAN OPENRC.
